_**1) Insights from Housing Data Analysis
**_

House Size Matters:
Homes with more living space (sq.ft living) tend to have higher prices.
Bigger basements and multiple floors also add value.

Location, Location, Location:
Houses in cities like Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond usually have higher prices.
Properties with a waterfront view or better scenery (view rating) tend to be more expensive.

Condition and Renovation:
Homes in better condition (rated 4 or 5) fetch higher prices.
Houses that were recently renovated may have a price boost compared to old, untouched homes.

Bedrooms/Bathrooms:
While more bedrooms and bathrooms increase price, the relationship isn't linear — it's about overall livability and layout, not just quantity.

Year Built vs. Renovated:
Newer homes or those renovated recently are priced higher than older, non-renovated ones.

Residential Property Investment

 Invest in regions with rising price trends and active listings – these are signs of healthy residential markets.City’s like – Kirkland, Redmond

Commercial Property

Target stability and visibility: Invest in commercial zones with consistent price or rental income trends.
  Eg: City’s like - Seattle, Renton
Avoid low-turnover areas unless entering with a long-term strategy (e.g., redevelopment, leaseholds).

For Real Estate Agencies

 Focus in services on high-activity regions (high sales/listing turnover) for faster client conversion.
 Use the data to identify emerging markets (e.g., suburbs with rising prices) and develop early presence.
 Offer property type specialization (e.g., family homes) based on demand patterns.
